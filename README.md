# Matching a Hex Value with Regular Expressions

This repository provides a tutorial on how to use regular expressions to match a hex value. Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching and validation, and understanding how they work can greatly enhance your web development skills.

In this tutorial, we will explore the regex `/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/` and break down each component to understand its purpose. We will learn how to validate whether a given string is a valid hex color value, allowing variations with or without the leading `#` symbol. The hex value can consist of either six or three characters from the set `[a-f0-9]`, representing the red, green, and blue (RGB) color channels.
